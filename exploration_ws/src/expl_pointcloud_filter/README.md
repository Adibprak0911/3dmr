# expl_pointcloud_filter

This experimental package `expl_pointcloud_filter` allows processing an input 3D scan, downsampling it and generating a lower-resolution output 3D scan that includes information about maximum range readings. The output scan should be carefully managed to avoid any confusion of the maximum readings as "obstacle" readings. 

See this [discussion](../../../README.exploration.md#exploration-configuration-and-maximum-sensor-readings).
